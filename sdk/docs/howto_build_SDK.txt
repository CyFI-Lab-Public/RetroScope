-----------
1- Foreword
-----------

This document explains how to build the Android SDK and the ADT Eclipse plugin.

It is designed for advanced users which are proficient with command-line
operations and know how to setup the pre-required software.

Basically it's not trivial yet when done right it's not that complicated.



--------------------------------------
2- Building an SDK for MacOS and Linux
--------------------------------------

First, setup your development environment and get the Android source code from
git as explained here:

  http://source.android.com/source/download.html

For example for the cupcake branch:

  $ mkdir ~/my-android-git
  $ cd ~/my-android-git
  $ repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b master -g all,-notdefault,tools
  $ repo sync

Then once you have all the source, simply build the SDK using:

  $ cd ~/my-android-git
  $ . build/envsetup.sh
  $ lunch sdk-eng
  $ make sdk

This will take a while, maybe between 20 minutes and several hours depending on
your machine. After a while you'll see this in the output:

  Package SDK: out/host/darwin-x86/sdk/android-sdk_eng.<build-id>_mac-x86.zip

Some options:

- Depending on your machine you can tell 'make' to build more things in
  parallel, e.g. if you have a dual core, use "make -j4 sdk" to build faster.

- You can define "BUILD_NUMBER" to control the build identifier that gets
  incorporated in the resulting archive. The default is to use your username.
  One suggestion is to include the date, e.g.:

  $ export BUILD_NUMBER=${USER}-`date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S`

  There are certain characters you should avoid in the build number, typically
  everything that might confuse 'make' or your shell. So for example avoid
  punctuation and characters like $ & : / \ < > , and .



------------------------------
3- Building an SDK for Windows
------------------------------

Full Windows SDK builds are now only supported on Linux -- most of the
framework is not designed to be built on Windows so technically the Windows
SDK is build on top of a Linux SDK where a few binaries are replaced. So it
cannot be built on Windows, and it cannot be built on Mac, only on Linux.

I'll repeat this again because it's important:

  To build the Android SDK for Windows, you need to use a *Linux* box.


A- Pre-requisites
-----------------

Before you can even think of building the Android SDK for Windows, you need to
perform the steps from section "2- Building an SDK for MacOS and Linux" above:
setup and build a regular Linux SDK. Once this working, please continue here.

Under Ubuntu, you will need the following extra packages:

$ sudo apt-get install mingw32 tofrodos

mingw32 is the cross-compiler, tofrodos adds a unix2dos command


B- Building
-----------

To build, perform the following steps:

$ . build/envsetup.sh
$ lunch sdk-eng
$ make win_sdk

Note that this will build both a Linux SDK then a Windows SDK.
The result is located at
   out/host/windows/sdk/android-sdk_eng.${USER}_windows/



----------------------------
4- Partial SDK Windows Tools
----------------------------

As explained above, you can only build a *full* SDK for Windows using Linux.
However sometimes you need to develop one specific tools, e.g. adb.exe or
aapt.exe, and it's just more convenient to do it on the same platform where
you can actually test it. This is what this section explains.


A- Cygwin pre-requisite & code checkout
---------------------------------------

You must have Cygwin installed. You can use the latest Cygwin 1.7 or the
the "legacy Cygwin 1.5" from:

  http://cygwin.org/

Now configure it:
- When installing Cygwin, set Default Text File Type to Unix/binary, not DOS/text.
  This is really important, otherwise you will get errors when trying to
  checkout code using git.
- Packages that you must install or not:
  - Required packages: autoconf, bison, curl, flex, gcc, g++, git, gnupg, make,
                       mingw-zlib, python, zip, unzip.
  - Suggested extra packages: diffutils, emacs, openssh, rsync, vim, wget.
  - Packages that must not be installed: readline.

Once you installed Cygwin properly, checkout the code from git as you did
for MacOS or Linux (see section 2 above.)



C- Building the Windows Tools
-----------------------------

This is the easy part: run make on the tool you want.
How do you know which tools you can build? Well obviously all the ones
that come in an installed SDK/tools or SDK/platform-tools folder!

Example, to build adb:

  $ cd ~/my-android-git
  $ . build/envsetup.sh
  $ lunch sdk-eng
  $ make adb

The result will be somewhere in out/host/windows-x86/bin/. Just look at
the output from make to get the exact path. Since you are building this
under cygwin, you get an unstripped binary that you can happily feed to
gdb to get debugger symbols:

  $ gdb --args out/host/windows-x86/bin/adb.exe <adb arguments>


And before you ask, msys is not supported, nor is MSVC or windbg.

So you can build a lot of little parts of the SDK on Windows, one tool
at a time, but not the full thing because basically building the whole
platform is not supported. This means you cannot build "android.jar"
nor "layoutlib.jar" under Windows. For this you want Linux.



D- Building the Windows Tools on Linux
--------------------------------------

You can also build isolated windows tools directly on Linux.
Again, it requires a checkout of the full android code and the usual
setup like described above to build an SDK.

Then to build an isolated Windows binary, you'd do something like this:

  $ cd ~/my-android-git
  $ . build/envsetup.sh
  $ lunch sdk-eng
  $ USE_MINGW=1 make adb

The special environment variable "USE_MINGW" must be set to 1. This is
the clue to switch the make logic to cross-compiling to Windows under
Linux.



-------------------------------------
4- Building an ADT plugin for Eclipse
-------------------------------------

We've simplified the steps here.
It used to be that you'd have to download a specific version of
Eclipse and install it at a special location. That's not needed
anymore.

Instead you just change directories to your git repository and invoke the
build script by giving it a destination directory and an optional build number:

  $ mkdir ~/mysdk
  $ cd ~/my-android-git   # <-- this is where you did your "repo sync"
  $ sdk/eclipse/scripts/build_server.sh ~/mysdk $USER


The first argument is the destination directory. It must be absolute. Do not
give a relative destination directory such as "../mysdk" -- this would make the
Eclipse build fail with a cryptic message:

  BUILD SUCCESSFUL
  Total time: 1 minute 5 seconds
  **** Package in ../mysdk
  Error: Build failed to produce ../mysdk/android-eclipse
  Aborting

The second argument is the build "number". The example used "$USER" but it
really is a free identifier of your choice. It cannot contain spaces nor
periods (dashes are ok.) If the build number is missing, a build timestamp will
be used instead in the filename.

The build should take something like 5-10 minutes.


When the build succeeds, you'll see something like this at the end of the
output:

  ZIP of Update site available at ~/mysdk/android-eclipse-v200903272328.zip
or
  ZIP of Update site available at ~/mysdk/android-eclipse-<buildnumber>.zip

When you load the plugin in Eclipse, its feature and plugin name will look like
"com.android.ide.eclipse.adt_0.9.0.v200903272328-<buildnumber>.jar". The
internal plugin ID is always composed of the package, the build timestamp and
then your own build identifier (a.k.a. the "build number"), if provided. This
means successive builds with the same build identifier are incremental and
Eclipse will know how to update to more recent ones.
