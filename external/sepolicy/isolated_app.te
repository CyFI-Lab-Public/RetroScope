### This file defines the rules for isolated apps. An "isolated
### app" is an APP with UID between AID_ISOLATED_START (99000)
### and AID_ISOLATED_END (99999).
###
### isolated_app includes all the appdomain rules, plus the
### additional following rules:
###

type isolated_app, domain;
permissive isolated_app;
app_domain(isolated_app)

# Appdomain interaction with isolated apps
r_dir_file(appdomain, isolated_app)

# Already connected, unnamed sockets being passed over some other IPC
# hence no sock_file or connectto permission. This appears to be how
# Chrome works, may need to be updated as more apps using isolated services
# are examined.
allow isolated_app appdomain:unix_stream_socket { read write };
