<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

The first versions of <b>ProGuard</b> grew out of <b>RetroGuard</b>, which its
author Mark Welsh kindly made available under the GNU Lesser General Public
License. <b>RetroGuard</b> is a very nice piece of code, but it only performed
obfuscation. I started from the class file parsing code and wrote my own
shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier. As of version 4.0, all of the
original code has been rewritten, so the most obvious remaining similarity are
the program names.
<p>

Dirk Schnelle has contributed and maintained the first versions of the Ant
task. I have rewritten the implementation for version 3.0, but the XML schema
is still based on his work.
<p>

Since its first public release, many people have expressed their enthusiasm and
have chimed in with interesting ideas, bug reports, and bug fixes: Thorsten
Heit, Oliver Retzl, Jonathan Knudsen, Tarcisio Camara, Bob Drury, Dave Jarvis,
Marc Chapman, Dave Morehouse, Richard Osbaldeston, Peter Hawkins, Mark
Sherington, David Sitsky, James Manning, Ptolemy Oberin, Frank-Michael Moser,
QZ Shines, Thomas Singer, Michele Puccini, Roman Bednarek, Natalia Pujol,
Daniel Sj&ouml;blom, Jan Filipsky, Charles Smith, Gerrit Telkamp, Noel
Grandin, Torbj&ouml;rn S&ouml;derstedt, Clemens Eisserer, Clark Bassett,
Eduard Welch, Dawid Weiss, Andrew Wilson, Sean Owen, Niels Gron, Ishan Mehta,
Steven Adams, Xavier Kral,
and many others. Thanks! Your feedback has been invaluable.
<p>

I am developing ProGuard in my spare time, which is possible thanks to my
day-time job at <a href="http://www.luciad.com/" target="other">Luciad</a>.
<p>

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/proguard/"
target="other">SourceForge</a> is generously providing the resources for
hosting this project and many other projects.
<p>

JetBrains is kindly providing a license for its IntelliJ IDEA development
environment.
<p>

The code and these web pages were written using Sun's JDKs, Linux, IntelliJ
IDEA, GNU emacs, bash, sed, awk, and a whole host of other tools that continue
to make programming interesting.
<p>

And finally, I'm a great fan of the <a
